# Coordinate Travel

## When to use

- "I'm going to {city}" / "plan my travel to {X}".
- "flights for {conference}" / "I have a customer visit in {X}".
- "assemble my trip pack".

## Steps

1. **Read `context/operations-context.md`.** If
   missing or empty, stop and ask you to run Head of
   Operations' `define-operating-context` first. Key-contacts and
   priorities anchor the "what meetings while there?" section.

2. **Clarify the trip.** Extract from your message:
   destination(s), dates (or date range), purpose (customer visit /
   conference / offsite / personal), traveling-with (solo / team).
   If dates or destination are missing and material, ask ONE
   question.

3. **Read travel prefs.** Read `config/travel-prefs.json`. If
   missing or empty, ask you ONE question: "What are your
   travel defaults — preferred airline, seat (aisle/window), hotel
   chain, dietary needs, accessibility?" Write the answer to
   `config/travel-prefs.json` and continue.

4. **Read schedule.** Read `config/schedule-preferences.json` for
   timezone. Check for existing calendar conflicts over the trip
   window via `composio search calendar` (pull events from depart
   to return date).

5. **Resolve travel connections.** `composio search travel` → check
   for connected travel providers (flight + hotel search). Note
   which categories are available. If none are connected, proceed
   with search criteria only and note that the user will book
   manually (no hardcoded provider assumption).

6. **Generate trip id** — `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{dest-slug}` (kebab-cased
   destination, e.g. `2026-05-12-sfo`).

7. **Write `travel/{trip-id}/trip.md`** — summary document.
   Structure:

   ```markdown
   # Trip — {destination}, {dates}

   ## Purpose
   {1–2 lines — customer visit / conference / offsite / personal}

   ## Dates
   Depart {YYYY-MM-DD} — Return {YYYY-MM-DD} ({N nights})

   ## Destinations
   - {city}, {country/state} — {nights}

   ## Key meetings while there
   - {date} — {attendee or event} — prep: {ready | missing}
   - ... (pulled from connected calendar for events in the trip window)

   ## Open questions
   - {anything the user should clarify before booking}
   ```

8. **Write `travel/{trip-id}/itinerary.md`.** Structure:

   ```markdown
   ## Flights

   ### Outbound
   - Search criteria: {origin} → {destination}, {date},
     {airline pref}, {seat pref}, {max stops}, {price ceiling if
     mentioned}
   - Candidate options (if a provider is connected): {list}

   ### Return
   - Search criteria: {dest} → {origin}, {date}, {same prefs}
   - Candidate options: {list}

   ## Hotels
   - Search criteria: {chain pref}, {nights}, {neighborhood near
     key meetings}, {price ceiling if mentioned}
   - Candidate options: {list}

   ## Ground transport
   - Airport → hotel → meetings
   - Preferred mode: {ride-share / rental / public}

   ## Pending bookings
   - [ ] Outbound flight
   - [ ] Return flight
   - [ ] Hotel
   - [ ] Ground transport
   ```

9. **Write `travel/{trip-id}/packing.md`** — checklist adapted to
   destination weather (best guess from destination + dates; note
   the assumption), trip type (formal customer visit vs conference
   vs offsite — clothing differs), and `config/travel-prefs.json`
   (dietary, accessibility). Sections: `## Essentials`, `## Work`,
   `## Clothing`, `## Health & toiletries`, `## Destination-specific`.

10. **Atomic writes** — `*.tmp` → rename per file.

11. **Append to `outputs.json`** with `type: "travel-pack"`, status
    "draft" until the user approves the bookings.

12. **Summarize to user.** "Trip pack ready at
    `travel/{trip-id}/`. Want me to search flight options via
    {available-provider} once you confirm the dates, or are you
    booking yourself? Also — should I block your calendar during
    the trip?"

## Outputs

- `travel/{trip-id}/trip.md`
- `travel/{trip-id}/itinerary.md`
- `travel/{trip-id}/packing.md`
- Possibly written `config/travel-prefs.json` on first run
- Appends to `outputs.json` with `type: "travel-pack"`.

## What I never do

- **Book** flights, hotels, or ground transport without explicit
  user approval on the specific option.
- **Charge** any card.
- **Commit** to travel dates on your behalf.
- **Invent** a destination event that isn't on the calendar or
  named by the user.
