# Spec Dashboard

## When to use

- "spec me a dashboard for {X}".
- "I want to see {metric group} regularly".
- "build a dashboard for the {growth / retention / churn / revenue}
  team".

## Steps

1. **Read `context/operations-context.md`.** If
   missing or empty, stop and ask you to run Head of
   Operations' `define-operating-context` first. Active priorities
   shape which metrics belong on the dashboard.

2. **Clarify audience + cadence.** If not clear: "Who's looking at
   this and how often? (operator daily / exec weekly / growth team
   daily / on-demand)." Defaults: `audience: "operator"`,
   `cadence: "daily"`.

3. **Propose metric list.** From `config/metrics.json`, pick the
   metrics that fit the purpose. If the user named metrics that
   aren't tracked, include them as placeholders with
   `sqlSnippet: ""` and recommend running `track-metric` first.

4. **Design sections.** 2–4 sections max. Canonical shape:
   - **Top-line KPIs** — 3-5 single-number tiles for must-knows.
   - **Trends** — 30/60/90-day time-series for the KPIs.
   - **Breakdown** — segmented view (segment / product area /
     cohort / channel).
   - **Anomalies / alerts** (optional) — latest flagged outliers
     from `anomalies.json`.

5. **Per-viz details.** For each visualization specify:
   - `title`
   - `chart`: `line` | `bar` | `number` | `sparkline` | `funnel` |
     `table`
   - `metricId` if it maps to a tracked metric
   - `sqlSnippet` — parameterized read-only SQL using `{{date}}` /
     `{{startDate}}` / `{{endDate}}` placeholders
   - `notes` — interpretation caveats or known DQ flags

6. **Self-check read-only.** Every `sqlSnippet` must be
   SELECT-only — scan for forbidden DML/DDL keywords and refuse if
   any appear.

7. **Write the spec** to `config/dashboards.json` (atomic). Append
   or update by `id`:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "growth-daily",
     "name": "Growth Daily",
     "audience": "growth team",
     "cadence": "daily",
     "sections": [
       {
         "title": "Top-line",
         "visualizations": [
           {
             "metricId": "signups",
             "title": "Signups (today)",
             "chart": "number",
             "sqlSnippet": "SELECT COUNT(*) AS value FROM events WHERE event='signup' AND DATE(ts) = DATE('{{date}}')",
             "notes": "Excludes bots flagged in users.is_bot"
           }
         ]
       }
     ],
     "createdAt": "...",
     "updatedAt": "..."
   }
   ```

8. **Append to `outputs.json`** with `type: "dashboard-spec"`,
   status "ready".

9. **Report.** Present the spec in chat with a one-line summary per
   section. Next step: "Paste this spec into your BI tool or ask me
   to translate a specific viz for {your tool}."

## Outputs

- Updated `config/dashboards.json`
- Appends to `outputs.json` with `type: "dashboard-spec"`.

## What I never do

- **Render HTML / a rendered dashboard** — spec only. The Houston
  Overview tab is separate and covers the operator's view. Your BI
  tool renders this spec.
- **Write `sqlSnippet`s that contain DML/DDL** — every snippet
  passes the forbidden-keyword scan.
- **Assume a specific BI tool** — the spec is tool-agnostic with
  parameter placeholders.
