description: "Use when you say 'write the engineering context' / 'draft our context doc' — I interview you briefly (or read your connected GitHub) and write the full engineering context doc (product, stack, architecture, quality bar, team, priorities, conventions) to `context/engineering-context.md`. Every other skill reads it first — until it exists, they stop and ask for it."

# Define Engineering Context

This skill OWNS `context/engineering-context.md`. No other skill
writes it. This skill creates or updates it. Its existence is what
unblocks every other substantive skill in this agent.

## When to use

- "write the engineering context" / "draft our context doc" / "let's
  do the context".
- "update the context doc" / "our stack changed, fix the context".
- Called implicitly by any other skill that needs context and finds
  the doc missing — but only after confirming with the user.

## Ledger fields I read / write

Reads `config/context-ledger.json` first. This skill is the primary
writer of:

- `universal.company` — name, website, 30s pitch, stage.
- `universal.product` — what it is, who uses it.
- `universal.engineeringContext` — flips `present: true`, sets
  `lastUpdatedAt` after write.
- `universal.priorities` — top 3 this quarter, quarter label.
- `domains.development.stack` — languages, frameworks, databases.
- `domains.development.sensitiveAreas` — auth, payments, migrations,
  public API, etc.
- `domains.development.qualityBar` — testCoverage + requiredChecks.
- `domains.reliability.cicd.provider` — github-actions / gitlab-ci /
  circleci / etc.

For anything missing, ask ONE targeted question per topic with a
modality hint (best first: connect GitHub via Composio > paste
README / CI config > URL > describe in 2 lines). Write each answer
atomically to the ledger, then continue.

## Steps

1. **Read the ledger.** Pull existing universal + development +
   reliability fields. For each missing required field, ask ONE
   question with a modality hint. Write answers to the ledger
   atomically (`*.tmp` → rename). Never ask the same field twice.

2. **Read the existing doc if present.** If
   `context/engineering-context.md` exists, read it so this run is an
   update, not a rewrite. Preserve anything the founder has already
   sharpened; change only what's stale or new.

3. **Pull fresh evidence if possible.** If the founder has a
   connected code host (via Composio), fetch:
   - Latest `README.md` — extract product description + quality-bar
     hints.
   - Latest CI config (`.github/workflows/*.yml`,
     `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.circleci/config.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`) —
     extract deploy cadence and test expectations.
   - Active milestones / labels from the connected issue tracker —
     cross-check priorities.

   Run `composio search code-hosting` / `composio search
   issue-tracker` to discover slugs at runtime. If no connection,
   work from ledger + user paste only and mark thin sections
   `TBD — {what to bring next}`.

4. **Draft the doc (~300-500 words, opinionated, direct).**
   Structure, in this order:

   1. **Product** — one paragraph: what the product is, who uses
      it, what makes it worth building now.
   2. **Stack** — languages, frameworks, DB, infra, CI/CD,
      observability. Each as a short bulleted row.
   3. **Architecture** — shape (monolith / microservices /
      serverless / mobile / hybrid), main module boundaries, any
      non-negotiable invariants.
   4. **Quality bar** — test coverage expectations, PR review rules
      (who reviews, what blocks), deploy cadence (continuous /
      weekly / on-demand), release gating (who approves).
   5. **Team shape** — named humans with timezones. On-call shape
      (usually "just the founder" for week 0).
   6. **Current priorities** — top 3 for the quarter, each with one
      line of context.
   7. **Conventions** — commit message format, branch naming, PR
      description template, sensitive areas. Concrete examples, not
      abstract rules.

5. **Mark gaps honestly.** If a section is thin (no quality bar
   defined yet, no conventions agreed), write `TBD — {what the
   founder should bring next}` rather than guessing. Never invent a
   stack choice, an invariant, or a priority.

6. **Write atomically.** Write to
   `context/engineering-context.md.tmp`, then rename to
   `context/engineering-context.md`. NOT under a subfolder. NOT
   under `.agents/`. NOT under `.houston/<agent>/`.

7. **Update the ledger.** Flip
   `universal.engineeringContext.present` to `true`, set
   `lastUpdatedAt` to now. Atomic write.

8. **Append to `outputs.json`.** Read existing array, append, write
   atomically:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "<uuid v4>",
     "type": "analysis",
     "title": "Engineering context updated",
     "summary": "<2-3 sentences — stack headline + architecture shape + what changed this pass>",
     "path": "context/engineering-context.md",
     "status": "ready",
     "createdAt": "<ISO-8601>",
     "updatedAt": "<ISO-8601>",
     "domain": "planning"
   }
   ```

   (The doc itself is a live file, but each substantive edit is
   indexed so you see the update on the dashboard.)

9. **Summarize to user.** One paragraph: what changed, what's still
   `TBD`, and the exact next move (e.g. "connect your CI provider
   and I'll fill deploy cadence"). Remind them every other skill
   now has the context it needs.

## What I never do

- Invent a stack, architecture choice, or priority. Missing data →
  `TBD` + what to bring next.
- Write the context doc to a subfolder, to `.agents/`, or under
  `.houston/<agent>/`. Always `context/engineering-context.md` at
  the agent root.
- Hardcode tool names — Composio discovery at runtime only.

## Outputs

- `context/engineering-context.md` (at the agent root — live document).
- Appends to `outputs.json` with `type: "analysis"`, domain
  `"planning"`.
